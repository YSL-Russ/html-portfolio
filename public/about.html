<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Mechanical Engineering Student currently in my 4th year at Mohawk College. 
  I am intermediately experienced with machine learning, 3D modeling, and Engineering 
  Design. Currently I'm working on getting my CSWA certification, and then soon 
  after my CSWP certification. </p>

  Relations, Automotive Equipment Installation, 3D CAD modelling softwares and Committed to 
  learning more. As I try to expand my skillset I found myself venturing into coding, which involved software 
  and web development. So as I learn and grown I am excited for whats to come.</p>
